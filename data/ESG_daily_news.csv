The agreement on loss and damage is a landmark moment in global climate politics  an acknowledgment that richer nations are responsible to the developing world for the harm caused by rising temperaturesBut the fractious summit, which took place against the background of a global energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, exposed fault lines on how the world should navigate the transition away from fossil fuelsAnd it did little to advance the ambitions of last year’s COP in Glasgow to rein in harmful greenhouse gas emissions"
2022-11-17,SLB Issuers Find Themselves Facing Possible Penalties,"The revival of fossil fuels in European energy policy risks triggering the first wave of financial penalties in the global market for ESG bonds. A test case is about to unfold in Greece, where energy supplier Public Power Corp. may find it “virtually impossible” to meet the end-of-year emissions target on some of its debt, according to an analysis conducted by the Anthropocene Fixed Income InstituteThat’s as regulators, government officials and industry representatives agree on crisis policies that are delaying the company’s phaseout of lignite coal production, which also may make it challenging to meet a separate 2023 target, AFII saidThe debt in question is a sustainability-linked bond. SLBs typically see issuers pay a penalty if they miss pre-determined ESG goals. But with Europe’s decision to ramp up coal production in response to the current energy crisis, near-term climate commitments are being derailed and leaving many utilities with little choice but to adapt"

Wednesday was Finance Day at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, when the UN climate talks shifted from discussing carbon dioxide in the air and ravaged communities and ecosytems on the ground to the dollars in bank accounts and investment portfolios that can be put to work to fund the transition to clean energyThe contrast to the same event just a year ago in Glasgow couldn’t have been greater. Unlike 2021, Quinn didn’t have the company of fellow big name CEOs such as Larry Fink of BlackRock, Bill Winters of Standard Chartered or Jane Fraser of CitigroupThe tone of the conversation also was also different from a year ago. Instead of dropping headline-grabbing announcements, panelists discussed the dry and unglamorous details of how to actually deliver on their commitments and what it means in practice for a bank or asset manager to eliminate their financed emissionsQuinn centered his comments on corporate transition plans. He said it was time to focus on the “science-based underpinning” behind corporate decarbonization proposals. He talked of forcing firms to “make clear how they’re going to change their capital investment,” what that means for individual sectors, and how progress might be measured"

Participants in the UK report include chairs such as Douglas Flint of Abrdn, Mark Tucker of HSBC Holdings, Stuart Rose of Asda Stores and Cressida Hogg of Land Securities GroupThe chairs said the proliferation of ESG rules was excessive and resulted in a culture of box-ticking.

Luke Barrs, managing director and global head of fundamental equity client portfolio management at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said “people are having to reassess holistically how they think about ESG integration”Just 18 months ago, a company in an ESG portfolio “could effectively burn cash for a number of years” to build up scale, “and there wasn’t a need to be cash- flow positive in the near term,” he said. That world “has kind of disappeared”After a year shaped by war, an energy crisis, decades-high inflation and rapidly rising interest rates, the world in which ESG investing got its foothold has been replaced by something far less hospitableFor fund managers “trying to build a holistic approach to assessing and integrating ESG into your portfolio, there has had to be some reassessment,” he said"
2022-10-27,Asset Managers May Soon Face Wave of Fund Downgrades,"Asset managers may need to downgrade hundreds of ESG funds in the coming months, as they struggle to land on the right side of European regulations.

2022-10-26,Fund Rules Draw Criticisms From European Regulators,"The world’s most far-reaching set of ESG investment rules is facing a wave of criticism as regulators in Britain and the European Union publicly voice their misgivings.

Environmental, social and governance investing has entered “Phase 3,” said Markus Müller, chief investment officer for ESG at Deutsche Bank’s private banking arm“With Phase 3, we are likely to have both consolidation and reorientation in ESG investing,” he said. “I don’t think that investors will materially reduce or stop allocations to ESG as they wait for better information, but they will continue to reassess and reorient investment approaches”The big game-changer for ESG this year has been the energy crisis. Fund managers who weren’t exposed to energy assets are now regrouping to make sure they don’t get wrong-footed againMüller points to the huge gains ESG investors have missed out on by snubbing oil and gas assets, with the S&P 500 Energy Index up more than 50% this year, while the broader S&P index is down almost 20%"

2022-10-10,Goldman Says Markets Yet to Grasp Full IRA Impact,"ESG investors are missing several opportunities created by President Joe Biden’s climate bill, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Almost two months after it was passed, the potential of the Inflation Reduction Act to support a number of sectors remains “underappreciated,” according to Brian Singer, an analyst at Goldman in New York. It’s a view he and his colleagues expressed shortly after the bill was enacted, and one that he still holds nowThe IRA, which became law in mid-August, offers incentives that “really have an impact on almost every  if not every  vertical that we see in the green capital expenditures mosaic of products that are going to be needed towards the path of net zero,” Singer said in an interviewThe bill’s support for key green industries such as solar, wind and electric vehicles is obvious. But the ramifications for the long chain of affiliated sectors have yet to be fully grasped by investors, the Goldman analysis shows. These include battery storage, solutions that make buildings more energy efficient, green hydrogen, as well as carbon capture and storage“ESG funds have historically been very overweight in solar, wind and water, and certainly as we’ve highlighted, the IRA is very supportive for solar and wind,” Singer said. “But it also provides more tailwinds for companies throughout the supply chain”  *T "

Akin to so-called poison pills that companies design to ward off hostile takeovers, green pills are financial contracts that would require a firm failing on its net-zero target to pay a chunk of money to a third party that’s doing a lot more to cut carbon emissions“Lots of firms are making good-sounding statements about what they’re hoping to do, but if you look at the way in which these statements are expressed, they’re hedged with many caveats,” said John Armour, professor of law and finance at the University of OxfordThe green pill “is a mechanism that companies might adopt for themselves to try to tie their hands,” Armour saidGreen pills don’t yet exist in the marketplace, but the concept was recently proposed by Armour and two other Oxford law professors, Luca Enriques and Thom Wetzer, in a working paper for the European Corporate Governance Institute"

Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick Thursday ruled Twitter must turn over information about 9,000 accounts it surveyed last year in hopes of identifying which had human beings attached to them. Twitter sought to deny Musk access to this “historical snapshot” on privacy and other groundsTwitter also “must produce documents sufficient to show how those 9,000 accounts were selected for review,” McCormick said in her ruling. At a hearing on Wednesday, Musk’s lawyers accused their Twitter counterparts of stonewalling them on the bots information in pre-trial information exchangesTwitter didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. “We look forward to reviewing the data Twitter has been hiding for many months,” Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, said in an emailed statement"

2022-08-18,Label Gets Stripped From 23% of EU Funds in Review,"Almost a quarter of funds that claim to “promote” sustainability under European regulations don’t deserve an “ESG” label, according to a fresh review by market researcher Morningstar Inc. The analysis, which looked at funds classified as Article 8 within the EU’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, shows that 23% don’t live up to environmental, social or governance investing principles, Boya Wang, ESG analyst at Morningstar, said in an interviewTo justify an ESG tag within Morningstar’s definition of the term, a fund’s investment strategy can’t rely only on excluding so-called sin stocks like tobacco, coal or weapons, Wang said. “Many Article 8 funds will not be tagged as sustainable funds under our framework,” he saidThe assessment is the latest to raise questions around a key pillar of Europe’s efforts to become of global champion of sustainability. No other jurisdiction has raced ahead with such an ambitious program for transforming the entire asset management industry.

2022-08-18,Rare Debt Product Seen as Key to Dodging Greenwashing,"A rarely-used financial product that makes it easier to monitor the performance of sustainable projects has been endorsed as a reliable way to avoid greenwashing in the $4 trillion ESG debt market. The idea combines green debt, where proceeds are broadly used to fund environmental projects, with sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs), where the amount of interest an issuer pays depends on whether it meets specific sustainability goals. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, which advocates for a faster transition from fossil fuels, said on Thursday that a hybrid model  so-called green SLBs  can ease investors’ greenwashing concerns and become best practice for sustainable debtSo far only a handful of green SLBs have found their way into the market, including one issued by Austrian electricity provider Verbund AG, and others by Japan’s Takamatsu Construction Group Co. and China’s Yunnan Provincial EnergyThe expectation is that more issuers will experiment with the structure, allowing investors to fund environmentally-friendly projects while giving companies an incentive to improve their sustainability performance"
2022-08-17,"As Hate Builds, Investment Movement Rethinks Its Name","A number of sustainable investing champions say it’s time for the “ESG” label to be shelved and replaced by something less likely to draw attacks from both the political right and left. Robert Eccles, a professor who’s spent the past 12 years researching sustainability at Harvard Business School and now University of Oxford’s Said Business School, says the term “just doesn’t have value anymore. Let’s change the conversation”ESG has this year become the subject of intense debate. As an acronym, it’s somehow morphed into a lightning rod for conservatives in the US, who use it to fire up attendees at Republican rallies. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis – a potential 2024 presidential candidate – wooed voters last month with a pledge to “protect” them from the ESG movement, which he claims threatens their economic freedom by putting “social causes” ahead of “the will of the people.”"

Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. posted record profits thanks to surging energy prices. The new US climate bill includes concessions to oil and gas companies. There are other, quieter beneficiaries: Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and the other cloud-services companies that are increasingly responsible for the computing horsepower behind the oil giants’ efforts to find and extract more oil and natural gas. Among other things, Microsoft is making it possible for Exxon to analyze reams of oil field data. Amazon is helping drillers run simulations to maximize how much oil they can pump from existing wellsIt’s an awkward look for companies that have pledged to cut their own emissions.

What’s more, the nearly $13 million fee that Jefferies proposed for handling the $3.4 billion offering wasn’t even the lowest. Several larger banks, including Morgan Stanley and UBS Group AG, asked for a smaller paymentBut Jefferies’ ultimately successful pitch to win the deal  which also touted its deep expertise in complicated bond structures  contained a point that many other large, national banks couldn’t put in their proposals: It has never run afoul of new, Republican-backed state laws seeking to punish Wall Street for limiting its work with the fossil fuels and firearms industries“We were not forced to resign from any transactions in the State nor were we identified in the press or mentioned in the State Legislative Hearings,” said the Jefferies proposal, obtained through a public-records request"

Michele Della Vigna, the head of Natural Resources research for EMEA at Goldman in London, says energy strategies favored by many ESG investors may have contributed to a lack of practical alternatives to coal. By failing to keep up investments in natural gas, investors helped feed a void in energy markets that’s now being filled by the dirtiest fossil fuel“A few years ago, when I talked to ESG investors, the focus was too heavily on just what not to invest in. No oil, no gas, no coal. And that led to a decrease in investments,” he said in an interview. “I am deeply disappointed that we are consuming more coal. That’s a direct consequence of under-investment in natural gas”The analysis feeds into a heated debate around the role of environmental, social and governance investing and coincides with the EU’s controversial decision to add gas and nuclear power to its ESG rulebook. That’s as the war in Ukraine exacerbates a supply crisis that has governments prioritizing energy security over climate goals, despite clear evidence of increasingly dangerous overheating"

That’s a laxer interpretation of the rule than many in the industry had been expecting and marks an “unexpectedly helpful” development for hedge fund managers, according to law firm Simmons & SimmonsThe clarification addresses one of the most complicated corners of Europe’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, and determines whether a fund can market itself as having taken into account the environmental and social impact of its actions. PAI disclosures are mandatory for investments firms with more than 500 employees but voluntary for smaller firms. Hedge fund managers  including those based in the UK and the US  had feared that opting in would mean they’d need to state firm-wide PAI risks rather than just those associated with products marketed to European clients"

But the decision didn’t erase the agency’s ability to regulate greenhouse-gas pollutants more broadly, nor did it leave it entirely toothless in the fight against climate changeThe agency still maintains the ability to regulate emissions from individual power plants, but now must move forward with more caution. Even before the ruling, EPA officials were planning new rules to regulate plant emissions, taking a narrower approach that would be focused squarely on coal- and gas-fired power plants, without bringing in non-emitting renewable electricityNow it seems likely that the narrow approach will be the clearest path forward after the Supreme Court stripped the agency of broader oversightThe EPA can still force significant emission reductions, “but it will be more costly and less effective,” said Jay Duffy, an attorney with the Clean Air Task ForceRead more: Supreme Court Crimps Biden’s Climate Agenda With Limits on EPA"

The leaders of Coatitila, a village in eastern Mexico, thought in 2019 they’d found a way to protect the dwindling forests and bring a serious change to a local economy where the average person earns only $6.40 a day when they can find workOne of the world’s most prestigious climate nonprofits, the World Resources Institute, was helping run a program that pays villages to reforest their communally owned woods and improve forestry management. Participation would bring in cash from oil giant BP, which would ultimately purchase carbon credits that the villagers generated, along with further funding from a US government agencyAfter two years of work, the village got its first annual payment in late 2021. The pay, split among 133 members of the community, amounted to about $40 each  whereas the village leader hoped they could earn as much as $44,000 in total per year.

It hasn’t got enough space for large solar installations, there are no major rivers for hydro and what little breeze the tropical city-state gets isn’t sufficient to push a wind turbine.

Now, the timeline has likely slipped to March or even laterThe conflict, which pits Gensler against his two fellow Democrats on the commission, is largely over how much information the agency can force companies to divulge without losing an almost certain legal challenge brought by Washington’s business lobby or a Republican-led stateAnother flashpoint involves whether auditors should sign off on the disclosures, ensuring they would be vetted by the same independent watchdogs who review corporations’ financial statements."

2021-12-05,Homeowners Are Rare Holdout in Rush for Green Debt,"Green mortgages are far from taking off in Europe. This type of loan is a rare laggard in a market for ethical debt that has exploded to record levels this year as climate change hits the top of the political and corporate agenda. It’s not from a lack of trying by banks, such as ABN Amro Bank, UniCredit and Swedbank, which are marketing green loans to homebuyers.

Negotiations on carbon trading are one of the key issues in Glasgow, Scotland, and a deal would represent a big success. The last round of talks in Madrid fell apart over the gnarly issue and it remains one of the last parts of the Paris Agreement that still needs to be hashed outThis is the debate: Developing countries want a percentage of the proceeds from trading all types of carbon credits. That sort of transaction tax has been applied to a previous UN offset program and is widely expected to continue in any new marketBut developing countries say it should also apply to the exchange of carbon credits between countries.

By contrast, developers are paying an average of about 10%The seeming irony of LGFVs cutting financing costs even as China’s broader real estate market goes through one of its toughest patches in years is largely down to the following: The entities are state-backed unlike their private-sector developer peers, even if some are also laden with debt. Many also have higher credit scores than those junk-rated property firmsThat makes them attractive even as speculative-graded firms from China Evergrande Group to smaller builders like Sinic Holdings Group face debt crises"
